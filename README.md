# Calculator-for-Investors

### Hyperskill project

#### Objectives

Let's break the task into several steps:

    Start with a welcoming message: Welcome to the Investor Program!;
    Display MAIN MENU;
    Ask for an option;
    When TOP TEN MENU is selected, display the menu;
        Ask for an option;
        When a valid option is selected, calculate the indicator;
        Find the top ten values;
        Print a ticker and indicator in the heading;
        Print the top ten values;
    Quit with a farewell message: Have a nice day!;

The code snippet below shows the formulas:

P/E = Market price / Net profit
P/S = Market price / Sales
P/B = Market price / Assets
ND/EBITDA = Net debt / EBITDA
ROE = Net profit / Equity
ROA = Net profit / Assets
L/A = Liabilities / Assets
